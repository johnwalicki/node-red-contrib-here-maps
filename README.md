# node-red-contrib-here-maps
A set of Node-RED nodes that encapsulate the HERE APIs and Maps

Use the [HERE.com APIs](https://developer.here.com/documentation) to build maps, navigation and other geolocation services into your Node-RED flows.

The HERE and IBM Developer Advocacy teams, with welcome assistance from our developer ecosystems, are planning to create these node-red-contrib-here-maps nodes so that is easy for Node-RED developers to incorporate maps, navigation and other geolocation services into your Node-RED flows.  Join us on this journey!

## Install (Not yet implemented)

Either use the Editor - Menu - Manage Palette - Install option, or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (typically `~/.node-red`).
```
$ npm install node-red-contrib-here-maps
```
